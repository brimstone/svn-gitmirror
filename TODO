* Push svn:gitauthors up and find the closest one of those instead
* Figure out hooks for auto creating repos on github and gitorious if they don't already exist
* Figure out pre-commit hook to look for svn:gitdesc, svn:gitauthors, git-svn, etc
* Write "installer" to run from this directory and configure the hooks in a svn repo
