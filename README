Little project to be used a a post-commit hook in a svn repo that then mirrors it to multiple git repos.

This way I have a "presence" on github without actually having to use git regularly. My workflow doesn't change and people get to see the cool stuff I work on.

Installation
============
* check this out somewhere, like /var/svn/svn:gitmirror
* make an ssh key with ssh-keygen
* import that into whatever service
* Make a repo on that service
* soft link your repo's post-commit hook to this one instead
* change post-commit to find this ssh script
* change the ssh script to find your sshkey
* start adding the properties svn:gitmirror and svn:gitauthors to your directories

svn:gitmirrors format:
git@whatever.tld/user/repo.git

svn:gitauthors format:
user=realname <user@domain>
